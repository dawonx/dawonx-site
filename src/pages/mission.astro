                <h2 class="mission-heading">Bridging Creativity & Computation</h2>
                <p class="mission-text">I believe computational design should amplify human creativity, not replace it. By developing intuitive tools and frameworks, I help architects harness the power of algorithms while maintaining their unique design vision.</p>

                <h2 class="mission-heading">Democratizing Sustainable Design</h2>
                <p class="mission-text">Advanced computational methods shouldn't be limited to elite firms. I work to make parametric design, environmental analysis, and optimization accessible to all architects committed to sustainability.</p>

                <h2 class="mission-heading">Cultivating Living Architecture</h2>
                <p class="mission-text">The future of architecture lies in systems that adapt, respond, and grow with their environment. Through bio-inspired design and material innovation, I explore how buildings can become living ecosystems.</p>
