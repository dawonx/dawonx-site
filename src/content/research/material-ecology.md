# Research Focus: Material Ecology

Material Ecology is a design philosophy and research field that seeks a deeper, more symbiotic relationship between the objects we make and the environment they inhabit. It represents a shift away from a world of assembled, machine-made parts and towards a world of grown, multi-functional, and biologically integrated systems. This research explores the intersection of computation, fabrication, and biology to create materials and structures that are in tune with nature.

## 1. Core Tenets of Material Ecology

Material Ecology is built on a set of principles that challenge the foundations of traditional design and manufacturing.

### From Homogeneous to Heterogeneous
Industrial materials are typically homogeneous and single-purpose (e.g., steel for strength, glass for transparency). In contrast, natural materials are almost always heterogeneous and multi-functional. A single piece of wood, for example, has varying density for structural support, porous channels for water transport, and a chemical composition that resists decay. Material Ecology seeks to create synthetic materials that mimic this functional grading, embedding multiple properties into a single substance.

### Resolution over Assembly
The industrial paradigm is one of assembly: joining discrete, single-property parts to form a larger whole. Material Ecology proposes a different approach: "resolution." This means designing with high-resolution gradients of material properties across scales. Imagine a single, 3D-printed building facade that transitions seamlessly from opaque and structural at its base to transparent and lightweight at its top, without any joints or separate components.

### Taming, not Assembling
This principle advocates for working *with* natural processes rather than against them. Instead of forcing materials into a desired shape, we can "tame" the growth processes of living organisms, like mycelium or bacteria, to create architectural-scale structures. The designer's role becomes one of a gardener, cultivating materials rather than manufacturing them.

## 2. Key Research Areas and Projects

Our research in Material Ecology is highly experimental, manifesting in a series of projects that test these core tenets.

### Water-Based Digital Fabrication
We have developed a method of 3D printing with a "bi-polymer" of chitosan (derived from shrimp shells) and cellulose (from trees). This water-based composite can be printed into large, complex structures. As the water evaporates, the structure's geometry and material composition dictate how it shrinks and folds, creating a pre-programmed final shape. This process uses no harmful chemicals and results in a fully biodegradable material.

### Biologically Augmented Structures
This research explores how to integrate living organisms directly into building components. One project, "Aguahoja," creates architectural-scale biocomposite structures that respond to the environment. These structures are designed to decay in a controlled manner when exposed to rain, releasing embedded seeds and nutrients to promote new growth. The building becomes a temporary nutrient-delivery system for the ecosystem.

### The Silk Pavilion
In this project, we explored the collaboration between a robotic arm and 6,500 live silkworms. The robotic arm first extruded a basic scaffold of silk threads. Then, the silkworms were placed on this scaffold, and they proceeded to spin their own dense, beautiful cocoon around the pre-defined shape. This demonstrated a new form of manufacturing, a partnership between machine and organism.

## 3. A Vision for a Material Future

Material Ecology offers a powerful vision for a more sustainable and ecologically integrated future. It suggests that the materials of our built environment do not have to be inert, polluting, and destined for a landfill. Instead, they can be intelligent, adaptive, regenerative, and part of a larger, circular material ecosystem. By learning from nature's design principles, we can begin to build a world where the things we make are not in opposition to the environment, but a seamless extension of it.
