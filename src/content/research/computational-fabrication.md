# Research Focus: Computational Fabrication

Computational Fabrication lies at the nexus of computer science, material science, and robotics. It is the study and development of processes that use computational methods to directly control fabrication machines, enabling the creation of objects with unprecedented complexity, functionality, and material intelligence. This research goes beyond simply using a 3D printer; it involves creating entirely new ways of making things.

## 1. The Evolution from Digital to Computational

To understand computational fabrication, it's important to distinguish it from earlier forms of digital fabrication.

### Digital Fabrication: The "What You See is What You Get" Era
First-generation digital fabrication (e.g., standard 3D printing, CNC milling) is primarily about translating a pre-defined digital model (a CAD file) into a physical object as accurately as possible. The digital model is a static blueprint, and the machine's job is to execute it faithfully.

### Computational Fabrication: The "What You Describe is What You Get" Era
Computational fabrication is a more sophisticated paradigm. Instead of a static blueprint, the input is a "procedure" or an "algorithm"—a description of *how* to make the object. The computation happens during the fabrication process itself, allowing the machine to make real-time decisions, adapt to material variations, and create objects that could never be designed with traditional CAD software.

## 2. Key Areas of Investigation

Our research in this field is focused on several key areas that push the boundaries of how we make.

### Multi-Material and Heterogeneous Printing
We are developing systems that can 3D print with multiple materials simultaneously, controlling the precise mixture and distribution of these materials at a microscopic level (or "voxel" level). This allows us to create objects with continuously graded properties. For example, we can print a single object that is rigid and opaque on one end and soft and transparent on the other, with a seamless transition in between. This is crucial for creating functional objects like custom medical implants or soft robotics.

### Robotic Additive Manufacturing
Standard 3D printers are limited by their small, enclosed build volumes. We are using large, industrial robotic arms as our fabrication machines. This allows us to print on a much larger, architectural scale. It also frees printing from the layer-by-layer approach. A robotic arm can deposit material in any direction and on any surface, enabling the creation of complex, non-planar structures that are stronger and more material-efficient.

### Sensing and Feedback Loops
This is a core component of "computational" fabrication. We are embedding sensors (like cameras and scanners) directly onto the fabrication machines. This allows the machine to scan the object as it's being made and compare the physical result to the digital model in real-time. If it detects an error or a material defect, it can automatically correct its path or parameters to compensate. This feedback loop leads to much higher precision and reliability, especially in complex prints.

## 3. The Impact on Design and Manufacturing

Computational fabrication is not just changing *how* we make things; it's changing *what* we can make and how we design them.

### Performance-Driven Design
By controlling the internal microstructure of a material, we can design objects based on their desired performance. We can create lightweight structures with internal lattice geometries that are optimized for strength, or print custom-designed lenses by precisely grading the refractive index of a clear polymer.

### The Digital Artisan
These technologies are also creating a new role for the designer: the "digital artisan." By writing the procedures and algorithms that guide the machines, the designer can imbue objects with a new kind of digital craftsmanship. It's a blend of artistic intent and computational control, leading to a new, computationally-driven aesthetic. The future of making is not just automated, but intelligent, adaptive, and expressive.
