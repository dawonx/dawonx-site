# Research Focus: Synthetic Biology in Design

Synthetic biology is an emerging field of research that applies engineering principles—like standardization, modularity, and abstraction—to biology. It aims to design and construct new biological parts, devices, and systems that do not exist in the natural world. Our research explores the profound implications of this technology for the world of design, architecture, and materials, asking: what if we could program living matter itself?

## 1. From Bio-Utilization to Bio-Synthesis

Design has long utilized biological materials (e.g., wood, leather). The recent trend of "bio-design" has focused on using living organisms as-is (e.g., growing mycelium bricks). Synthetic biology represents the next evolutionary step: not just using biology, but actively designing it.

### The Genetic Toolkit
At the core of synthetic biology is the ability to read, write, and edit DNA. With tools like CRISPR, scientists can now make precise changes to an organism's genetic code. This allows us to create "genetic circuits," analogous to electronic circuits, that can sense inputs, process information, and produce outputs.

### Designing Biological "Apps"
One can think of an organism's cell as a computer, and DNA as the operating system. Synthetic biology is about creating "apps" that run on this biological hardware. An "app" could be a genetic circuit that instructs a yeast cell to produce a specific fragrance, or tells a bacterial cell to produce a biopolymer when exposed to a certain chemical.

## 2. Applications in a Designed World

The potential to program living cells opens up a revolutionary new design space. Our research is focused on prototyping these future applications.

### Living Materials and Self-Healing Structures
Imagine a concrete that can heal its own cracks. We are exploring how to embed bacterial spores within a concrete matrix. When a crack forms, water seeps in and activates the dormant bacteria. The bacteria then execute a genetic program that causes them to precipitate calcite (limestone), sealing the crack. This is a material that can sense damage and repair itself.

### Bio-Sensors and Responsive Environments
Living organisms are incredibly sensitive to their environments. We are designing genetic circuits that enable bacteria to detect specific pollutants or toxins in the air or water. These engineered bacteria can then be programmed to produce a visible output, such as a change in color, when the toxin is present. By embedding these "bio-sensors" into building materials or household objects, we could create environments that actively monitor their own health and communicate that information to us.

### Sustainable Bio-Manufacturing
Many of the products we use today, from plastics to pharmaceuticals, are derived from petroleum and produced through energy-intensive processes. Synthetic biology offers a sustainable alternative. By engineering the metabolic pathways of organisms like yeast and E. coli, we can turn them into microscopic factories. These cellular factories can take simple sugars as an input and be programmed to produce a vast range of outputs, including biofuels, high-performance fabrics, and complex medicinal compounds, all at room temperature.

## 3. Ethical Considerations and the Future

The power to reprogram life itself carries immense ethical responsibility. A core part of our research is dedicated to fostering public dialogue and developing frameworks for the responsible development of this technology. Key questions include ensuring the bio-containment of engineered organisms and addressing the potential for unintended ecological consequences.

The vision is a future where biology is a design medium. A future where we don't just build *with* nature, but *design* nature to build for us. It's a future of self-healing buildings, air-purifying walls, and materials that are grown, not manufactured—a future where the boundary between the living and the built environment dissolves.
